# RatVenture (PRG Assignment)
## By Nur Hakimi B Mohd Yasman

This project was the final assignment for us Year 1 students taking the PRG1 module. We were given the outline and gist of what the game should look like, how the game should function and what some of the features and functions should be added. Essentially, we just had to build a product according to what the brief described it to be.

## **Features**

- Save files
- Move system
- Battle system
- Heal system
- Item power-up randomly placed, but not too close to starting position
- Boss battle
- Leaderboard
- Randomised town locations

### **Features left to implement**
1. Shop system
    * Let players buy items with coins achieved from battling rats, at towns
1. Improve on the randomising system of the orb item
    * The code for randomising the orb location is iffy, and can be improved.

## **Technologies Used**

### **Languages**
Name | Purpose
------------ | -------------
[Python](https://www.python.org) | The only thing used to code this, really.

## **Quick reflection**

This was my first real product from programming, and it's a really humble beginning. I can still see my novice coding skill in the code, specifically my hard code for randomising the orb location, but it's really good to see where I started and where I am now. It tells me that given time and effort, I can pick up anything and make it work well.
